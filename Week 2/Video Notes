Trial and event: 
    Cointains a specific number of events where each event may have a particular outcome. Coin flips

Binomial dist generator
rbinom(n=20, size=6, prob=0.5) n= trials size= events prob= chance of each event

 set.seed() to set randomness from that point on 

accumalitive prob in R
    cumsum(table) the categories accumalate as they go on eventually hitting 1.00 for the last event all the probabilities add up to 1
